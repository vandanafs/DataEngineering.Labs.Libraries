    "## Lessons learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the dataframe above, you'll see our scoring method performed very poorly. This is for a number of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The vectorization we used is extremely simplistic and just uses word counts. In a real world application, a data scientist would use a far more advanced embedding method.\n",
    "- Our dataset is fairly small, and it seems like the Fantasy genre doesn't have many unique words like we'd hoped.\n",
    "    - We can tell this by looking at the top 10 tokens in the training set. They don't seem particularly 'fantasy-like' to me:\n",
    "        - ['book', 'find', 'four', 'life', 'new', 'one', 'power', 'series', 'seven', 'world']\n",
    "- There's clearly a high amount of linguistic overlap between Fantasy, Non-Fiction, Young Adult, and Sequential Art book descriptions. You can tell this by looking at the highest scoring books in our out of sample test we ran. 14 out of the top 20 scoring books fall into one of those genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So - how do we improve on this?\n",
    "- Experiment with different numbers of features to look for. We started with 10, but you should expreriment toggling it up and down. Keep in mind that when you add tokens, even though it might make finding the genre easier, you also run the risk of catching other erroneous genres. This is a double edged sword.\n",
    "- Turn the above steps into a sklearn pipeline so that you can easily run a few dozen attempts, and so that the data scientist you're likely building this pipeline for can easily grid search on it.\n",
    "- Use a better vectorization method. There are lot's of better ways to do this that are more likely to be used in the real world:\n",
    "    - TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency. This method lowers the value given to a word if it appears many times in the overall dataset. So for example, in our book descriptions we're looking at we're specifically looking for words that are common to *only* the Fantasy genre. Words that are generally common like 'book' or aren't particularly helpful.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Use something more advanced than word frequency based methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lemmatize the words. This is cutting the words down to just their stems so that words with similar roots are grouped together.\n",
