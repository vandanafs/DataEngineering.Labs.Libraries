    "## Intro To Webscraping\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to learn how to scrape data from a website. It is quite common that you might want to scrape a bunch of data from a website in order to analyse it. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Scrape a bunch of comments/social media posts to analyze sentiment\n",
    " - Scrape a bunch of data saved as .csv files somewhere\n",
    " - Pull public records that don't have a native download option on the webpage\n",
    " - etc, etc\n",
    " \n",
    "Webscraping is SUPER powerful, because it enables you to create datasets out of almost anything you can find online. We'll walk through a toy example here, and then you can feel free to identify the website of your choice and scrape away!\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll need some tools before we get started:\n",
    "\n",
    "I should point out, there are multiple frameworks to use for webscraping: beautifulsoup/selenium+chromedriver/requests/urlib are all fairly common and are used for different applications. Each scraping task will require slightly different capabilities, and require choosing the correct tooling. We'll focus on the first two here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, make sure you have Chrome. You should already, as it's the best browser on the planet :)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Second, download and run the appropriate: <a href=\"https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads\">ChromeDriver</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Third, make sure you have both selenium and beautifulsoup4\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## -----------DISCLAIMER!!!-------------WARNING!!!--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Many websites prohibit webscraping. This is not to say people don't do it all the time anyways, but we'll need to play by the rules here. If you search online, there are many awesome uses/examples/tutorials on webscraping. One common excercise is to scrape Indeed or LinkedIn for job postings in a given city, to figure out the most in demand skills. The problem is, many of the job boards prohibit scraping. So, just for liabilities sake, we're going to do a toy example here. <a href=\"http://toscrape.com\">Toscrape.com</a> is a free website that was specifically set up for scraping, so we can play around with it without worrying about a specific site's Terms of Service changing on us."
